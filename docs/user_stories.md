## Resusable components for developpers

The main goal of this project is to deliver a framework of geospatially enabled smart contracts and libraries for secure Geo-dApps developement.

1. The developper should be able to use a deployed `crypto-spatial` smart contracts and libraries that suit his business needs from ENS (ens.domains) resolvable Ethereum addresses.

1. The developper should be able to inherit/use the Solidity components to build his custom contracts and develop more complex decentralized systems.

1. The developper should be able to integrate/donwload the solidity reusable components (contacts) from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and/or [ethPM](https://www.ethpm.com/) as standalone packages or included in a widely accepted library, like [openZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/).
